# Introduction

The concept of blockchain was first introduced as the backbone of Bitcoin. Intuitively, a blockchain is a distributed database that is securely managed by multiple parties. Since the creation of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have gained popularity that starts a flourishing period of blockchain technology, and financial trading markets using digital coins. One of the most significant extensions of the original blockchain concepts is a smart contract that thrives to enable more complex features than simple transactions to be enforced with a blockchain. Particularly, a smart contract, which is a computer programming code that is replicated across clients in a blockchain network, expresses pre-defined protocols among involved parties, and the blockchain facilitates the verification and enforcement of agreements without relying on any trusted third parties.

Since the advent of this technology, organizations, from trade finances to insurance, and many other fields of industries, have been continuously exploring smart contract applications and their potential for building Dapps (decentralized applications). Among several popular blockchain platforms supporting the smart contract feature, Ethereum is the worldâ€™s first smart contract platform but also the most popular choice among developers, making its development community one of the most flourishing and responsive to this day. The most significant factors that make Ethereum's smart contract platform being the top choice is its standardization, security, and support through community guides and resources, i.e. [solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/), [EIP](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs), [Openzeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org), [Web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.2/).... With eloquently written rules, and clearly defined development guidelines, deploying smart contracts and Dapps on the platform has proven to be comparatively easy.

However, excessively high gas fees and common pitfalls or limitations of Solidity, a language being used to code smart contracts, potentially degrade the scalability, extension of smart contracts developing on Ethereum. Many projects have considered or already migrated theirs to other blockchain platforms that also support smart contracts, i.e. Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon (Matic), Solana, and also Cardano. Apparently, a cost of migration and other challenges should be accounted for. As a matter of fact, this event comes into place to solve a crucial problem of project migration from Ethereum to another blockchain in which Cardano is a chosen one.

# Project Challenges

We highly appreciate your participation in this challenge, building NFT Marketplace on Cardano network. In this event, there are five topics as follows:

- Challenge 1 [ERC-20](./Challenge1.md)
- Challenge 2 [ERC-721](./Challenge2.md)
- Challenge 3 [ERC-1155](./Challenge3.md)
- Challenge 4 [Marketplace](./Challenge4.md)
- Challenge 5 [Lobster](https://github.com/input-output-hk/lobster-challenge): since the lobster challenge has been released for one month, and there might be some solutions that can be found online. Thus, the original one needs to be modified to make it fair. Instead, this challenge requires using prime numbers (from 1 to 10000)
- Challenge 6: to encourage your innovation, you are free to choose your topic, to design and to implement your logic.

For the submission, please pick at least one challenge.

**Note that**: Challenge 1, 2, and 3 are higher preferable. If you can finish one of these challenges, that's a plus

**Minimal acceptance criteria**:

- Your contract must be successfully deployed on Cardano network (local or public testnet).
- NFTs can be minted or traded.

**Submission**:

- Source Code repo (must be opened to the public at the time of submission)
- Contract address (as proof of successful deployment) that you deploy your codes
- Deadline for submission: 24:00 PM, 30 Oct 2021 (Vietnam time). Earlier submission will be a plus.

**Prizes**:

- 1 Gold values $400
- 1 Silver values $300
- 3 Bronzes value $200 for each

Spores has the right to use all the submitted codes without any consent from the authors. All the rules are subject to change by the organizer without any notice.
